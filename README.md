# Speedrunning Helper

Speedrunning Helper is a datapack for Minecraft Java, added a lot of useful features for speedrun.

It is designed to be used in a short parkour maps compared to *CubeRunner Parkour Datapack* (another parkour datapack I made), providing additional features for speedrunners (e.g. a PB system that can record the time of each checkpoint), while the latter is more suitable for a normal parkour map.

Note that this datapack have not been tested in multiplayer games and may have issues with multi players. If you're looking for a multiplayer friendly parkour datapack, check [*CubeRunner Parkour Datapack*](https://github.com/klue007/CubeRunner-Parkour-Datapack) which is mentioned above.

## How to Use It
***(Super detailed)***
1. Download the datapack;
2. Unzip it;
3. Put it in `.\datapacks` in your world folder;
4. Open your world in Minecraft;
5. Type `/function main:helper`;
6. Then you get a book;
7. Move to the place where you want to create a new checkpoint;
8. Open the book you got in step 6;
9. Click `[Add a new checkpoint here]` on your book;
10. Go back to step 7 until you created all the checkpoints. If you created a checkpoint at a wrong place, click `[remove the last checkpoint]`. Or you want to start over creating checkpoints, then click on `[remove all]`.
11. Congratulations on your making great progress! Now press `Q` to discard the book.
12. Last step! Type `/trigger restart` or use a hotbar item called "Restart". Now that you're at the starting point, start parkouring and enjoy!
